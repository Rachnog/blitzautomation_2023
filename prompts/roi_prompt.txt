I am building an AI app that generates mindmaps from text.
I want to calculate the ROI over time, month by month. Assume the following variables:

Costs:
- team costs: $10'000 / month
- cloud costs: $300 / month
- an average single generation cost: $0.1 per cloud API

Revenue:
- paying users pay $1 per each generation

Users:
- initial number of users - 50 monthly
- initial number of generations per user monthly - 10 monthly
- the percentage of paying users - 10% monthly

Growth:
- growth of team costs - 10% quarterly 
- growth of cloud costs - 5% monthly
- growth of users per month - 50% monthly
- growth of the number of generations per free-tier user per month - 10% monthly
- growth of the number of generations per paying user per month - 50% monthly
- growth of the percentage of paying customers - 20% monthly

The table should have the following columns with the ROI:
- month
- users monthly
- the percentage of paying users
- paying users monthly
- generations monthly
- generations monthly of paying users
- monthly cost (sum of team, cloud and generation costs of all users, paying and not paying)
- monthly revenue (only from paying users)
- cumulative revenue (only from paying users)
- monthly ROI, in $
- cumulative ROI, in $

Generate a $ ROI table (cumulative and monthly), each row is a month, for 12 months
