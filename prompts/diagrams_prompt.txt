Create Python code that can generate and save a visual diagram of a software architecture. 

The parts of the diagram are:
- AWS S3 bucket as a data lake
- AWS Sagemaker hosting a custom ML model
- AWS EC2 instance hosting the backend web app
- AWS EC2 instance hosting the frontend web app
- 3rd party API (OpenAI) used in the backend web app

The backend app takes data from the data lake and sends requests to the OpenAI API and custom ML model. The Frontend app is sending requests to the backend app.
