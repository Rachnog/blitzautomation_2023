    "        23 Wall Street, also known as the J.P. Morgan Building, is an office building in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, at the southeast corner of Wall Street and Broad Street. The four-story building, designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in the Neoclassical style, was constructed between 1913 and 1914. When it was damaged during the Wall Street bombing in 1920, J.P. Morgan & Co. refused to make repairs to defy the bombers. The building was the firm's headquarters until 1989, when the company moved to 60 Wall Street. During the 2000s, there were plans to convert 23 Wall Street into condominiums. The building was sold in 2008 to interests associated with the billionaire industrialist Sam Pa. It has mostly remained empty, although it has been used for events. The building is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); it is also a contributing property to the NRHP-listed Wall Street Historic District. \n",
